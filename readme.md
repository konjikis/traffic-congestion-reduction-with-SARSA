# Traffic Congestion Reduction with SARSA

## Introduction

The project aims to address traffic congestion issues caused by excessive vehicle demand. Intelligent traffic control
focuses on enhancing traffic flow and reducing average wait times. Effective traffic signal timing is crucial for
resolving traffic problems. However, finding an optimal solution is challenging due
to numerous influencing factors. Traditional traffic light controllers lack the ability to learn from past experiences,
hindering their adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions.

To overcome these limitations, a reinforcement learning-based approach, specifically a Sarsa(λ)-based real-time traffic
control optimization model, is proposed. This model adapts and learns optimal actions by considering vehicle traffic
costs, which include delay time and the number of waiting vehicles. The Sarsa(λ) algorithm enables
the model to learn from its experiences, leading to more effective traffic signal timing policies. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in traffic control, highlighting the model's potential in facilitating dynamic,
real-time traffic management.
